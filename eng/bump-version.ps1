.SYNOPSIS
Sets the version of clypse's next release, and gets its changelog ready.

.DESCRIPTION
Run on a branch before releasing; then push, merge to main and run the Release workflow on main.

The version is set in one place, VersionPrefix in Directory.Build.props: every project takes it from there, Settings >
About shows it, and the Release workflow tags v<version> from it. The script:

  1. Sets VersionPrefix to the new version: -Version, or the next minor version (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0).
  2. Turns the Unreleased section of CHANGELOG.md into the new version's section, and starts an empty Unreleased. The
     Release workflow uses that section as the release notes.

If the current version has not been released (there is no GitHub release v<version>), no bump is needed, and the script
offers to add the Unreleased changes to it instead: the version stays, and the Unreleased notes join its changelog
section. Answer n to bump anyway. -Version always bumps.

It only changes files; review them with git diff, then commit.
